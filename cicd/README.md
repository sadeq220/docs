### CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)     
CI/CD falls under DevOps (the joining of development and operations teams).     
CI/CD automates build, test (including integration tests, unit tests, and regression tests), and deploy phases, as well as infrastructure provisioning.     

Continuous Integration: Is the practice of integrating all your code changes into the main branch of a shared source code repository early and often,     
Nowadays, it is typically implemented in such a way that it triggers an automated build with testing.
