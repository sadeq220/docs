## Firmware in terms of BIOS and UEFI   
Firmware is a permanent software programmed into a read-only memory(**ROM**) hence the name "firm" . 
Firmware may be written into **ROM**, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory(**EEPROM**), or **flash memory**.   
You can think of firmware as "software for hardware", it serves as an intermediary layer between the hardware and the higher-level software.   
Firmware is responsible for controlling various hardware components, such as processors, memory, input/output devices, sensors, and network interfaces.
Firmware is usually written in low-level programming languages like *assembly* or *C*.

### BIOS is motherboard firmware.
