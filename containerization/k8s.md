## Kubernetes(K8S) orchestrator    
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for     
automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.     
The open source project is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

K8S facilitates both `declarative configuration` and automation, and provides `reliable, scalable distributed systems`.
