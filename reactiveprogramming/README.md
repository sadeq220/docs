## Reactive programming paradigm[^1]    
### Vert.x, Reactor, reactive streams specification, RxJava    
> As a first step in the direction of reactive programming, Microsoft created the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library in the .NET ecosystem. Then RxJava implemented reactive programming on the JVM.          
> As time went on, a standardization for Java emerged through the Reactive Streams effort, a specification that defines a set of interfaces and interaction rules for reactive libraries on the JVM.Its interfaces have been integrated into Java 9 under the Flow class.     

> The reactive programming paradigm is often presented in object-oriented languages as an extension of the Observer design pattern.    
> You can also compare the main reactive streams pattern with the familiar Iterator design pattern, as there is a duality to the Iterable-Iterator pair in all of these libraries.      
> One major difference is that, while an Iterator is pull-based, reactive streams are push-based.     

>Using an iterator is an imperative programming pattern, even though the method of accessing values is solely the responsibility of the Iterable.    
> Indeed, it is up to the developer to choose when to access the next() item in the sequence. In reactive streams, the equivalent of the above pair is Publisher-Subscriber.    
> But it is the Publisher that notifies the Subscriber of newly available values as they come, and this push aspect is the key to being reactive.     
> Also, operations applied to pushed values are expressed declaratively rather than imperatively: The programmer expresses the logic of the computation rather than describing its exact control flow.    

Today's software is shifting to more asynchronous, event-based solutions.For decades, the Observer pattern has been the go-to event infrastructure, but it is known to be bug-prone.     
Functional reactive programming (FRP) replaces Observer, radically improving the quality of event-based code.

### Asynchronous, non-blocking code in JVM  
Synchronous(ly) : Executes on the calling Thread.    
By writing asynchronous, non-blocking code, you let the execution switch to another active task that uses the same underlying resources and later comes back to the current process when the asynchronous processing has finished.
Java offers two models of asynchronous programming:     
- Callback
  - Asynchronous methods do not have a return value but take an extra callback parameter that gets called when the result is available.
  - e.g. kafkaProducer.send(producerRecord,callback);
- Futures 
  - Asynchronous methods immediately return a Future<T>. The asynchronous process computes a T value, but the Future object wraps access to it.    
  - e.g. ExecutorService#submit(runnable)

Reactive libraries, such as Reactor, aim to address these drawbacks of “classic” asynchronous approaches on the JVM while also focusing on a few additional aspects:    
- `Composability` the ability to orchestrate multiple asynchronous tasks, in which we use results from previous tasks to feed input to subsequent ones.    
  - trying to accomplish this with Callbacks results in *Callback Hell*.     
- `Backpressure` or the ability for the consumer to signal the producer that the rate of emission is too high.     
- High level abstraction that is concurrency-agnostic.
---
### Reactive Streams Specification
The purpose of Reactive Streams is to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure.    
In summary, Reactive Streams is a standard and specification for Stream-oriented libraries for the JVM that     
- process a potentially unbounded number of elements
- in sequence
- asynchronously passing elements between components
- with mandatory non-blocking backpressure.

The API consists of the following components that are required to be provided by Reactive Stream implementations:
- **Publisher**
- **Subscriber**
- **Subscription**
- **Processor**

A *Publisher* is a provider of a potentially unbounded number of sequenced elements, publishing them according to the demand received from its Subscriber(s).

In response to a call to `Publisher.subscribe(Subscriber)` the possible invocation sequences for methods on the `Subscriber` are given by the following protocol:

```
onSubscribe onNext* (onError | onComplete)?
```
This means that `onSubscribe` is always signalled,    
No further notifications will be received until Subscription#request(long) is called.(**Demand**)     
It is the responsibility of this Subscriber instance to call Subscription#request(long) whenever more data is wanted.    
followed by a possibly unbounded number of `onNext` signals (as requested by `Subscriber`) followed by an `onError` signal if there is a failure, or an `onComplete` signal when no more elements are available—all as long as the `Subscription` is not cancelled.    

Signal 	As a noun: one of the *onSubscribe*, *onNext*, *onComplete*, *onError*, *request(n)* or cancel methods. As a verb: calling/invoking a signal.

### Reactor core(Reactive Streams Implementation)
The Reactor project main artifact is reactor-core, a reactive library that focuses on the **Reactive Streams specification** and targets Java 8.
org.reactivestreams.Publisher implementations: `Flux` , `Mono`
A Flux object represents a reactive sequence of 0..N items, while a Mono object represents a single-value-or-empty (0..1) result.    
A Mono<T> is a specialized Publisher<T> that emits at most one item via the onNext signal.     

> Obtaining a Flux or a Mono does not necessarily mean that it runs in a dedicated Thread.     
> Instead, most operators continue working in the Thread on which the previous operator executed.     
> Unless specified, the topmost operator (the source) itself runs on the Thread in which the subscribe() call was made.

Nothing Happens Until You subscribe()
>when you write a Publisher chain, data does not start pumping into it by default. Instead, you create an abstract description of your asynchronous process

Meaning mono.map() or mono.flatMap() won't execute until mono.subscribe()     

Triggered event is called `sink` in the reactor library context. sink types:
- SynchronousSink
- FluxSink
- MonoSink

Programmatically creating a reactive sequence:

1) This is for synchronous and one-by-one emissions, meaning that the sink is a SynchronousSink and that its next() method can only be called at most once per callback invocation.
```java
// SynchronousSink - synchronous generate

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class SynchronousGenerate {
  public void testSynchronousSequence() {
    Flux<Integer> synchronousSequence = Flux.generate(() -> 0, (state, synchronousSink) -> {
      sink.next(synchronousSink);
      if (synchronousSink.equals(15))
        synchronousSink.complete();
      return ++synchronousSink;
    });
    synchronousSequence.subscribe(integer -> {
      System.out.println(Thread.currentThread() + "  " + integer);
    });
  }
}

```

2) It exposes a FluxSink, with its next, error, and complete methods. Contrary to generate, it doesn’t have a state-based variant. On the other hand, it can trigger multi-threaded events in the callback.

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
// create doesn’t parallelize your code nor does it make it asynchronous
public class AsynchronousCreate {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ThreadGroup customPool = new ThreadGroup("customPool");
    customPool.setDaemon(true);

    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10, runnable -> new Thread(customPool, runnable));

    Flux<String> asynchronousSequence = Flux.create(fluxSink -> {
      fluxSink.next("hello");
      fluxSink.next("how are you?");
      fluxSink.complete();
    });
    executorService.submit(()->
            asynchronousSequence.subscribe(event->{
              // computation logic
              System.out.println(Thread.currentThread()+ "   " + event);
            })
    );
  }
}
```
Mono.create() 


Reactor Context (since version 3.1.0)     
To propagate states between reactive operators, Reactor provides a mechanism similar to `ThreadLocal` in imperative programming.     
reactor.util.context.Context doc     
> A key/value store that is propagated between components such as operators via the context protocol.

One example of incompatible libraries with Reactor that rely on ThreadLocal would be: Using the MDC of Logback to store and log correlation IDs     

```
String key = "message";
Mono<String> r = Mono.just("Hello")
    .flatMap(s -> Mono.deferContextual(ctx ->
         Mono.just(s + " " + ctx.get(key))))
    .contextWrite(ctx -> ctx.put(key, "World"));

StepVerifier.create(r)
            .expectNext("Hello World")
            .verifyComplete();
```

For example spring SecurityContext is stored on Reactor Context:     
```
Mono.deferContextual(Mono::just)
				.cast(Context.class)
				.filter(ReactiveSecurityContextHolder::hasSecurityContext)
				.flatMap(ReactiveSecurityContextHolder::getSecurityContext);
```

## spring WebFlux
Why was Spring WebFlux created?
- need for a non-blocking web stack to handle concurrency with a small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware resources.
- offer functional web endpoints alongside annotated controllers

Spring WebFlux is based on Reactor library, and HTTP server acts as a **Subscriber** which can control the backpressure based on network bandwidth.     
Spring WebFlux is supported on Tomcat, Jetty, Servlet containers, as well as on non-Servlet runtimes such as Netty and Undertow.     
Spring MVC relies on Servlet blocking I/O and lets applications use the Servlet API directly if they need to. Spring WebFlux relies on Servlet non-blocking I/O and uses the Servlet API behind a low-level adapter.     

> If you have blocking persistence APIs (JPA, JDBC) or networking APIs to use, Spring MVC is the best choice for common architectures at least.    

The key expected benefit of reactive and non-blocking is the ability to scale with a small, fixed number of threads and less memory.      
That makes applications more resilient under load.    
non-blocking servers use a small, fixed-size thread pool (event loop workers) to handle requests.     
The reactive WebClient operates in event loop style.     

#### Server* and Web* classes
In Netty server we have "ServerHttpRequest" and "ServerHttpResponse" instead of traditional "HttpServletRequest" and "HttpServletResponse".    
 and "ServerWebExchange" contains both "ServerHttpRequest" and "ServerHttpResponse".    
Spring WebFlux, similarly to Spring MVC, is designed around the front controller pattern, where a central WebHandler, the `DispatcherHandler`, pass requests to delegate components.     
Also in Netty we have org.springframework.web.server.`WebFilter` instead of jakarta.servlet.Filter, which spring-security relies on.      

`HttpHandler`: basic contract for reactive http request handling, web servers(e.g. Netty) implement this interface  
> Basic contract for HTTP request handling with non-blocking I/O and Reactive Streams back pressure.    

```java
public interface HttpHandler {
    Mono<Void> handle(ServerHttpRequest request, ServerHttpResponse response);
}
```
returned Mono completion signal represents end of http request processing.     

`WebHandler`: provides web applications needed features, such as session, request attributes.    

```java
public interface WebHandler {
	Mono<Void> handle(ServerWebExchange exchange);
}
```

`WebHttpHandlerBuilder`: creates the chain of multiple WebExceptionHandler, multiple WebFilter, single WebHandler.

## Vert.x tool-kit     
Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit(collection of libraries) for building reactive applications on the JVM.     
the focus of Vert.x is processing asynchronous events, mostly coming from **non-blocking I/O**,         
and the threading model processes events in an **event loop**.

#### Traditional synchronous connection
Managing concurrent network connections by allocating a thread for each connection.     
This is the model in many technologies, such as Servlets in Jakarta EE (before additions in version 3).
The socket I/O operations are synchronous, so threads may block on I/O operations.    
For example, writing to a socket may block, such as until the underlying TCP buffer data has been sent over the network.   

The idea behind non-blocking I/O is to request a (blocking) operation,    
 and move on to doing other tasks until the operation result is ready.(apply a level of indirection[^2] like creational design patterns)    
In this model, many concurrent connections can be **multiplexed** on a single thread, as network latency typically exceeds the CPU time it takes to read incoming bytes.    

### Multiplexing event-driven processing: The case of the event loop    
A popular threading model for processing asynchronous events.    
Events are pushed to an `event loop`(queue).    
A single thread is assigned to an event loop, and processing events shouldn’t perform any blocking or long-running operation.     

Javascript runtime model is based on an `event loop`.     
JavaScript is single-threaded, but it never blocks by using the event loop model.    
For example Javascript can process user input while it waits for fetch() request to return.     
![javascript event loop](./the_javascript_runtime_eventloop.svg)

messages in message queue is processed only when the stack frame is empty.      
> The processing of functions continues until the stack is once again empty.    
> Then, the event loop will process the next message in the queue (if there is one).

>At some point during the event loop, the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue,starting with the oldest one.     
> To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter.      
> As always, calling a function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.

> The event loop got its name because of how it's usually implemented, which usually resembles:
```js
while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
  queue.processNextMessage();
}
```
> queue.waitForMessage() waits synchronously for a message to arrive (if one is not already available and waiting to be handled).    


### Reactive systems(reactive manifesto)     
Reactive System is and how it goes beyond “just” asynchronous programming.     
Reactive System properties are **Responsive**, **Resilient**, **Elastic** and **Message Driven**.     
- responsive: Consistent response times.     
- Resilient: meet failure with elegance. how to handle crashing nodes, how to handle services in **degraded-mode**
  - > Resilience is achieved by replication, containment, isolation and delegation
- Elastic: scale on demand(horizontal scaling), code design impact is shared state across instances needs to be well identified and limited (e.g., server-side web sessions should be stored in redis). 
  - >This implies designs that have no contention points or central bottlenecks, resulting in the ability to shard or replicate components and distribute inputs among them.
- Message-Driven: Using asynchronous message passing rather than blocking RPC(e.g., using RabbitMQ, apache KafKa)

#### reactive Imperative - reactive functional
A **callback** is an approach to reactive programming done imperatively.    
`reacting to change`:  A spreadsheet is a great example of reactive programming: cells dependent on other cells automatically “react” when those other cells change.        
Reactive-functional programming is an abstraction,an abstraction on top of imperative systems—that allows us to program asynchronous and event-driven.    
Reactive-functional programming is solving is concurrency and parallelism.
